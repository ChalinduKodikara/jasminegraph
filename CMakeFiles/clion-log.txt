CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:8 (add_executable):
  Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target JasmineGraph because
  there is a cycle in the constraint graph:

    dir 0 is [/usr/local/lib]
      dir 1 must precede it due to runtime library [libmetis.so]
    dir 1 is [/home/chalindu/local/lib]
      dir 0 must precede it due to runtime library [libmetis.so]

  Some of these libraries may not be found correctly.
